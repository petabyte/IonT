SEIS - 785 IOT Project
Create an Internet of things device that will log and monitor music practice
Use a microphone sensor to log sound coming from instrument and create a telemetry log of how long it has been playing
Must recognize sound signature for each instrument
(Maybe even compare the sound captured to actual music sheet data – need to digitize music sheet to have a comparison)
Calm Technology – gives feedback using led light to indicate status of practice
Gives feedback while playing – chose blue led lights to indicate that the sound is being logged
Elasticsearch – used elasticsearch because of  potentially huge number of events that will be logged. Need the search capability to act or aggregate key events for all the logged events. This can be done efficiently thru a query in elasticsearch.
